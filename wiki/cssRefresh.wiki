CSS Refresh is a bookmarklet that reloads all CSS link tags within the current website.

It's really helpful while developing a website and making minor changes to CSS, thus avoiding to reload the whole site. It only works if you made no changes to the markup, of course.

In order to use it, you must drag and drop into your browser's favlist or copy-paste it.
